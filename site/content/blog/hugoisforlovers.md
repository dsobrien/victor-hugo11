# Wet n Wild: Cruelty Free Cosmetics OpEd

Wet n Wild, a Los Angeles based beauty brand, offers affordable, well-made products. Most of Wet n Wilds products can be purchased for less than ten dollars at any major drug store.

A major selling point for Wet n Wild is that they offer cruelty free merchandise. When purchasing beauty products this is often a concern because many companies test on animals, or use animal by-products in their items. Wet n Wild consumers can feel at ease knowing that no animals were harmed or tested on during the making of their products. Not only are Wet n Wild’s products 100% cruelty free, most of them are vegan as well. Wet n Wild is an advocate for PETA’s “Beauty without Bunnies” program and believes in “beauty without cruelty first” according to its website.

Wet n Wild is not just ethically sound, it offers great products as well! Wet n Wild offers a plethora of beauty products ranging from make-up brushes and nail polish to eyeshadow and highlighter. A very beloved crowd (and personal) favorite is Wet n Wild’s “Megaglo Highlighting Powder” in the “precious petals” shade. Originally this product was released as a seasonal exclusive. Beauty lovers searched high and low to purchase this holy grail highlighter, but it was sold out in almost every drugstore just days after its release.

The highlighter now has a forever home on Wet n Wild’s website and the product has been continued in their regular line. This highlighter, coupled with the cruelty free factor, and the many other amazing products makes Wet n Wild a considerable favorite among many make-up lovers.
