# IOC & 2016 Rio Olympics OpEd

The 2016 Olympics were full of crime, scandal, and overwhelming concerns. It is safe to say Brazil was not ready to host an event of that caliber. The continuing lousy economy, and unforeseen threat of the Zika virus all contributed to the demise of the Olympic games.

The XXXI Olympiad was held August 5, 2016- August 21, 2016 on the beaches of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The first games to be held in a South American country.

The poor economy, and political dismay affected preparations prior to the Olympics. In the months leading up the games, economist Bruno Rovai stated that the economy of Brazil was not getting better and that they were suffering politically as well. Neil Shearing of Capital Economics said Brazil’s economy was “weak in key parts.” The country’s morale was low as the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, was in the process of impeachment.

While hosting the Olympics is a great opportunity for a country that is struggling economically; is it always the best decision?

Brazil’s fiscal troubles affected viewership. Brazilians were unable to afford tickets for events, leaving stands empty. Turning on your television to see so many empty seats in the risers diminishes the grand excitement that the Olympics brings.

The economic crisis also affected Brazil’s capability to prepare for this highly anticipated event. With just a few weeks left before the Opening Ceremonies, concerns heightened as the tennis center, BMX park, and volleyball stadium were all unfinished and under construction.

Brazil had 7 years to get ready for the Olympics, but failed to adequately prepare. They hurriedly finished the venues before the start of the games, but according to the Daily Mail people were afraid this would not give much time to run tests to be sure everything was up to par and safe to use. The first run of the Olympic metro line was just 4 days before the Opening Ceremonies even though it was set to open in 2014. The Washington Post reported that transportation experts did not believe they allowed enough time for safety testing of the metro line.

When accommodating such a large amount of people from all of the globe, one would think safety would be a prime concern.

Aside from the obvious issues with unfinished construction of venues, the safety of the athletes and Olympic teams was a concern as well. When you’re gathering the world’s most elite competitors, safety should be a top priority. However, Brazil had too many issues to worry about, and safety concerns were overlooked and neglected.

Midway through the games, as viewers turned on their TVs to watch diving, they would see that the once crystal clear water in the pool turn into an emerald green. Divers weren’t able to see the bottom of the pool which they need for spotting, and technical purposes. One event was even moved to another location so athletes wouldn’t have dive into the green, murky water.

The sailing and windsurfing competition was held in the contaminated waters of Guanabara Bay. The health of the athletes was not a concern as they continued the competition in the polluted waters of the bay. The New York Times disclosed that the Brazilian government only spent $170 million of the promised $4 billion that was intended to clean up the bay.

The Olympic Village was not a pretty sight either. This is where all of the athletes, trainers, and officials stay during the length of the games. Outsiders are not allowed into the village in order to protect the athletes. These protections may not have even been necessary as many Olympic directors claimed the village was inhabitable. Australia’s Olympic leader, Kitty Chiller, moved her team from the Olympic Village because of plumbing and electrical issues.

Other athletes didn’t even make it to the games to begin with. The looming threat of the Zika virus caused multiple athletes from different countries to pull out of the Olympics entirely. Some cited they withdrew due to fears of passing the virus to loved ones, and affecting their ability to start a family one day.

These concerns caused many to question whether or not the 2016 Olympics should be postponed.

Scientists and health professionals pressed to have the Olympics moved from Rio. The International Olympic committee did not see the Zika virus as a threat and continued to support Brazil as the 2016 Olympic host. The virus coupled with all of the other issues should have brought up major red flags in the decision to hold the Olympics in Rio.

Unfortunately, these problems overshadowed the accomplishments of the Olympic athletes. Day after day the press reported more stories on the negative occurrences in Rio, rather than highlighting the Olympians and their hard work. The well-being of the athletes should come first and foremost, not money and publicity.
