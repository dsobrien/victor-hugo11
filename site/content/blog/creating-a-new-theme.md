## Back to the Homeland!

I recently went on an AMAZING trip to Europe with my boyfriend where I visited Spain, Croatia, and Italy. Prior to this trip I had never left the country (I know, CRAZY!) but now I definitely have the traveling bug. All the countries were absolutely beautiful but my favorite had to be Croatia. And as a Croatian, I think my family may have disowned me if it wasn’t.

In our adventures we tried to experience each city in a way the locals would, but of course there are certain things such as the Dubrovnik City Walls and Diocletian’s Palace in Split that you just can’t miss out on. For those of you who don’t know much about Croatian culture it has a big focus on family – think My Big Fat Greek Wedding – and that pretty much sums it up.

We thought one of the best ways to experience the culture would be by shopping at local markets and cooking dinner ourselves. From our Air BnB we were able to walk this underground “tunnel” (in the picture above ^^^) that came up right in front of a supermarket! There we were able to purchase hand made pasta, fresh vegetables, breads and of course Croatian beer and wine! It was fun to cook pasta using the local ingredients and not feel pressured to head inside of a touristy restaurant. And to top it off we were able to enjoy dinner on the balcony of our Air BnB – which had breathtaking views of the Adriatic Sea and Coastline!

I’ll be posting more of our adventures from Dubrovnik and Split in my upcoming posts – so be on the lookout for that!
